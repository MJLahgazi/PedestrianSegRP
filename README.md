# PedestrianSegRP

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8.8-blue.svg)

## Description

PedestrianSegRP is a Python source code used in the scientific paper titled "Improving pedestrian segmentation using region proposal-based CNN semantic segmentation." The paper's DOI is [DOI: 10.23939/mmc2023.03.854](https://doi.org/10.23939/mmc2023.03.854).

The code performs pedestrian segmentation on images using a two-stage segmentation process. It utilizes region proposals generated by YOLO v3 and segmentation masks generated by UNet, providing accurate and efficient pedestrian segmentation results.

## Features

- Pedestrian segmentation using region proposal-based CNN semantic segmentation.
- Utilizes YOLO v3 for region proposals and UNet for segmentation masks.
- Provides accurate and efficient pedestrian segmentation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MJLahgazi/PedestrianSegRP.git
```
1. Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python 3.8.8 installed.

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
```

1. Download the YOLO v3 weights file named yolov3_320.weights and place it in the root directory. Unfortunately, the file is too large to be included in the repository.

2. The images used for tests are placed in the folder "test_images."

## Usage
1. Load the required models and libraries.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
import csv
import time
```

Follow the instructions in the scientific paper to understand and utilize the code effectively.
